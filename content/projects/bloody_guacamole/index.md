Organized crime and violence represent important constraints to economic growth. One of the channels where criminal organizations restrict growth is through its impact on firm performance. My research question for this project is how do firms react to organized crime exposure? Profitability of certain industries may make them a targe of criminal organizations. I focus on the avocado industry in Mexico to exploit two important characteristics: a boom in demand following NAFTA and Mexico's privileged position as the main exporter to the United States market, and the concentration of production in regions with high exposure to drug cartels. How does the presence of these criminal organizations and their extortionary tactics affect the functioning of existing firms and decisions of potential entrants? Is there misallocation arising from it and what is its extent?
