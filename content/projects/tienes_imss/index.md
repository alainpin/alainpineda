title: The Impact of Social Insurance Expansion on Youth Employment
subtitle: Evidence from Mexico

---

In 2016 the Mexican government affiliated more than 3 million high school students to the national social insurance institution and began providing basic medical benefits attached to their school enrollment. This paper combines differences across cohorts induced by the exposure to the policy with differences across states in initial informality rates to study the impact on labor market outcomes. Relative to less informal states, exposed cohorts in highly informal areas show higher participation, employment, and formality rates. There is no significant impact on school attendance and monthly income. The formalization effect is sizable, with an additional percentage point in the initial state informality rate being associated with an increase of between 0.4 and 1 percentage points in the formality rate among exposed cohorts.
