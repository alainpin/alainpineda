Informal employment, understood as productive activity that is not properly registered by the government, is a key characteristic of labor markets in many developing countries. In Mexico, almost 60% of total employment is informal and this proportion has maintained relatively stable over the years. An area that has been underexplored is the impact of informal employment and its determinants at the micro level. For this project, I study a policy enacted recently in Mexico where students enrolled in public high schools and colleges started receiving medical benefits associated with social insurance while they were attending school. My research question is how did this social insurance expansion affect the career trajectories that the population affected had, with particular emphasis on the informality rates of their first jobs. I exploit exposure to the policy by cohorts and heterogeneity in pre-policy informality rates to analyze the impact of the policy on labor force participation, unemployment, informality, income, and school enrollment.
