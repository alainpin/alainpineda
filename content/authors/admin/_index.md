I am studying my Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University as a Knight-Hennessy Scholar. I am interested in studying labor markets in developing countries, particularly the dynamics of informal employment. 

I am originally from Mexico City and previously worked in the Research Department of Mexico’s central bank (Banxico). I received my MA and BA in Economics from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM).

For my undergraduate thesis I studied the determinants of informal job duration in Mexico. This work was recipient of the Citibanamex Economics Award in 2017.
